# OOP Project - C#

This project contains multiple C# programs that demonstrate the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**

## Project Structure

- `bank-maram.cs`: A simulation of a banking system using OOP classes and methods.
- `system-maram.cs`: Contains core system functionalities and logic separation.
- `Test-maram.cs`: A test file to validate and demonstrate the features of the classes.

## Purpose

This project is part of my training in the **Makeen Bootcamp**, where I applied OOP principles to real-world examples using C#.

## Key Concepts

- Creating and using classes with constructors and methods.
- Implementing inheritance between classes.
- Demonstrating method overriding (polymorphism).
- Using access modifiers to apply encapsulation.
- Structuring code into separate files for clarity and reusability.

## How to Run

You can run the project using any C# IDE like **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code**:
1. Open each file.
2. Compile and run `Test-maram.cs` to see the results.

 *This project is for learning purposes and demonstrates a practical application of OOP in C#.*
